                    <p>The Japanese-Language Proficiency Test (日本語能力試験, Nihongo Nōryoku Shiken), 
or JLPT, is a standardized criterion-referenced test to evaluate and certify Japanese language 
proficiency for non-native speakers, covering language knowledge, reading ability, and listening ability.
The test is held twice a year in Japan and selected countries (on the first Sunday of July and December), 
and once a year in other regions (on the first Sunday of December).
The JLPT consists of five levels.Until 2009, the test had four levels,
 with 4 being the lowest and 1 being the highest level of certification.[4] JLPT certificates do not expire or become invalid over time.</p>
